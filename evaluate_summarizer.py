    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a strategic asset for businesses across the globe. By automating repetitive tasks, AI allows employees to focus on creative and high-value work. However, adoption of AI also comes with challenges, such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the high cost of implementation. Organizations must balance innovation with ethical considerations to ensure responsible and sustainable growth.",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a transformative role in healthcare. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images to detect diseases such as cancer at earlier stages. Personalized medicine is another major area where AI tailors treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle, and medical history. Despite its benefits, the use of AI in healthcare raises significant ethical and legal concerns.",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping society in profound ways, influencing how we work, learn, communicate, and make decisions. Governments are using AI for policy analysis, infrastructure planning, and public safety initiatives. Social media platforms rely on AI algorithms to filter content, detect harmful behavior, and recommend relevant posts."
